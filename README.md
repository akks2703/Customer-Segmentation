# E-commerce Customer Segmentation Analysis
Welcome! In this repository you will find an IPython Notebook (.ipynb) file consisting of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering analysis project on a dataset from an e-commerce company.  

Problem Statement
A dataset comprising data on an e-commerce company's clients is provided to you. The
columns in the dataset are as follows:
Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer
Age: The age of the customer
Gender: The gender of the customer
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
Spending Score (1-100): A rating is given by the company based on consumer spending
patterns and behavior

The given task is to perform the following analysis using Python:
● Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
● Investigate the distribution of the data, the relationships between variables, and any
missing values or outliers by using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
● Perform clustering analysis to segment customers into different groups based on their
Annual Income and Spending Score. Use the elbow method to identify the optimal
number of clusters.
● Visualize the clustering analysis results using a scatter plot, with each cluster having a
different colour.
